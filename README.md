# EF Canvas Themes

## Requirements
The easiest way to view the templates is by using [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server). This requires that you have Node running on your machine. You can install `http-server` via:

`npm install http-server -g`

Then, from within the project directory, run

`http-server`

and navigate to the URL in the terminal.
